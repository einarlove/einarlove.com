<h1>Desk – The future of teaching</h1>
<p>Team Plaid is Ario, Einar, Morten og Torbjørn</p>

<h2 id="intro">Letting teachers focus on teaching</h2>

<p>The most important part of any school are the teachers. No technology can replace a passionate teacher with good teaching skills. The key to improving education is to empower teachers with good tools they can use in their teaching. In addition, minimizing the amount of work that isn't directly relevant to teaching, such as organizational tasks is also important because they'll have more time to focus on teaching.</p>


<h3>The problem</h3>

<p>Planning the teaching material for a whole year is an exhausting task, and is definitly a major time theft. The teachers find themselves spending too much time and effort on these tasks. One of the major benefits of saving time on these tasks, is the addition of time they get on increasing the educational quality.</p>

<p>There are several small niggling tasks, such as keeping track of the pupil's progress on certain subjects. Isolated, these tasks are not difficult, but the time spent on evaluating the students eats up a huge amount of time. This time could be better spent on improving their teaching and optimizing the learning experience.</p>


<h3>Our solution</h3>

<p>By introducing an interactive solution (Desk) to teachers that can help them do their every day administrative chores, they'll get more time on their hands. This enables them to concentrate more on the education and can give each student the optimized experience he/she needs. </p>

<p>Desk is a digital platform-independent, aswell as economically and culturally independent web based application that helps teacher organize their workday.</p>

<p>The teacher can easily rate each class depending on their attendance, concentration and response in the classroom. "Desk" will provide the teacher with suggestions on how to change the schedule in the future, based on facts stored in the system.</p>

<p>Desk will provide with the neccessary tools to tailor each school day to the student's needs. True the use of simple daily data-input, the teacher will get a clear overview of the class and thus making time to increase the quality of the education. The excess time may be used to follow up on the students, on a more individual level.</p>

<p>We believe that Desk is a much needed tool for teachers in the future. By giving teachers more free time, the student will experience a more personal and optimized learning proccess. By improving the communication between teachers/students, social and academic problems may be discovered at a earlier stage. This will hopefully make the school a better place to be, both for teachers and students.</p>
